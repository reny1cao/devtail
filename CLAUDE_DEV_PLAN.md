# DevTail Development Plan - Backend & Infrastructure Focus

## Overview
This plan focuses on what I can effectively help you build: the backend infrastructure, protocols, and gateway components that will power your Termius+AI mobile app.

## Phase 1: Core Backend Infrastructure (Week 1-2)

### 1.1 Real Aider Integration
- [ ] Replace `mock-aider.py` with actual Aider CLI integration
- [ ] Implement proper subprocess management with PTY
- [ ] Handle Aider's interactive prompts and responses
- [ ] Add context management for long conversations
- [ ] Implement file watching for Aider's edits

### 1.2 WebSocket Protocol Optimization
- [ ] Design Protocol Buffer schemas for all message types
- [ ] Implement binary WebSocket frames
- [ ] Add compression (zstd for best mobile performance)
- [ ] Build message fragmentation for large responses
- [ ] Create efficient diff-based file sync protocol

### 1.3 Terminal Backend
- [ ] Implement PTY management in Go
- [ ] Build terminal size negotiation protocol
- [ ] Add ANSI escape sequence handling
- [ ] Create terminal session recording/replay
- [ ] Implement copy/paste protocol

## Phase 2: Performance & Reliability (Week 3-4)

### 2.1 Connection Management
- [ ] Build connection state machine
- [ ] Implement exponential backoff reconnection
- [ ] Add connection multiplexing
- [ ] Create session resume protocol
- [ ] Build heartbeat/keepalive system

### 2.2 Gateway Optimization
- [ ] Implement connection pooling
- [ ] Add request/response caching
- [ ] Build rate limiting per user
- [ ] Create backpressure handling
- [ ] Optimize memory usage for mobile clients

### 2.3 Tailscale Integration
- [ ] Add Tailscale Go SDK to gateway
- [ ] Implement direct peer-to-peer mode
- [ ] Build connection upgrade from relay to direct
- [ ] Add Tailscale status monitoring
- [ ] Create fallback mechanisms

## Phase 3: Developer Experience (Week 5-6)

### 3.1 File Operations
- [ ] Build efficient file sync protocol
- [ ] Implement syntax-aware diff generation
- [ ] Add file watching with debouncing
- [ ] Create atomic file operations
- [ ] Build Git integration for status/diff

### 3.2 AI Enhancement
- [ ] Add prompt template system
- [ ] Implement context window management
- [ ] Build token usage tracking
- [ ] Create response caching layer
- [ ] Add fallback to different models

### 3.3 Testing Infrastructure
- [ ] Build WebSocket protocol test suite
- [ ] Create load testing framework
- [ ] Add latency measurement tools
- [ ] Build mobile network simulation
- [ ] Create integration test harness

## Implementation Order (What I'll Build)

### Week 1: Foundation
```bash
# 1. Fix Aider integration
cd gateway
# - Update aider.go to use real Aider CLI
# - Handle subprocess lifecycle
# - Parse Aider output correctly

# 2. Create Protocol Buffers
mkdir -p pkg/protocol/proto
# - Define all message types
# - Generate Go code
# - Update WebSocket handler
```

### Week 2: Terminal Support
```bash
# 1. Implement PTY handler
cd gateway/internal
mkdir terminal
# - Create pty.go for PTY management
# - Build session manager
# - Handle resize events

# 2. Update WebSocket for terminal
# - Add terminal message types
# - Implement stdin/stdout proxying
# - Handle control sequences
```

### Week 3: Performance
```bash
# 1. Add compression
# - Implement zstd compression
# - Make it configurable
# - Test on mobile networks

# 2. Connection resilience
# - Build state management
# - Add reconnection logic
# - Implement message queuing
```

### Week 4: File Sync
```bash
# 1. File operation protocol
# - Design efficient diff format
# - Implement file watcher
# - Build sync algorithm

# 2. Git integration
# - Add git status monitoring
# - Implement diff generation
# - Handle merge conflicts
```

## Deliverables I Can Provide

1. **Production-Ready Gateway**
   - Binary WebSocket protocol
   - Real Aider integration
   - Terminal multiplexing
   - File synchronization

2. **Protocol Documentation**
   - Complete Protocol Buffer definitions
   - Message flow diagrams
   - Integration guide for mobile devs

3. **Testing Tools**
   - WebSocket test client
   - Performance benchmarks
   - Load testing scripts
   - Network simulation

4. **Deployment Setup**
   - Docker containers
   - Kubernetes manifests
   - Monitoring configuration
   - Auto-scaling policies

## Success Criteria

- **Latency**: <10ms gateway overhead
- **Throughput**: 10MB/s file transfers
- **Reliability**: 99.9% message delivery
- **Efficiency**: <1KB/min idle traffic
- **Scalability**: 10K concurrent connections per instance

## What You'll Need to Handle

1. **Mobile Development**
   - Native terminal renderer
   - iOS/Android Tailscale SDK
   - UI/UX implementation
   - App store submissions

2. **Infrastructure**
   - Cloud provider setup
   - CDN configuration
   - Database hosting
   - Monitoring services

## Let's Start

I recommend we begin with fixing the Aider integration since that's a critical piece that's currently mocked. Should I start implementing the real Aider integration in the gateway?
